# Developer Documentation

## Developers

* Julius Kiekbusch
* Fabian Mildner

## Division of Work

The following division of work should not be understood as a sign that one person worked entirely on a given task. Much rather, it should be interpreted as the person being the *main person in charge* for fulfilling the given tasks. Many tasks were subject to mutual corrections, adjustments and agreements that were performed by both developers. 

### Julius Kiekbusch

## Developing and Building the Website

* Images and XML files as well as JavaScripts and Cascading Style Sheets can be saved directly in the docs folder and corresponding subfolders
* Final HTML files contain elements that repeat across several webpages. As such, those repeating partials have been taken out of the development (source) HTML files and are only inserted through a build step
* Development HTML files and insertible partials should be saved in the src folder (and corresponding sub-folder)

* To build the website, you need to install NodeJS and the Node Package Manager (npm).
* To install necessary packages for the build and watch steps, run `npm install` once from within the root of this repository
* Afterwards, you can build webpages (i.e. assemble development html files with their partials) using `npm run build`
* In addition, you can start browsersync for easier development and testing using `npm run watch`
